This Jupyter Book compiles my laboratory and lecture tasks for **DS413: Deep Learning**.
It serves as a record of my progress throughout the course and highlights the key concepts, methods, and applications I learned.

The goal of this compilation is to:
- Demonstrate my ability to design, train, and evaluate deep learning models
- Apply these models to real-world datasets and problems
- Build a structured record of my progress and results across the semester

Beyond completing course requirements, this Jupyter Book also serves as a personal reference for future research and projects related to artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning applications.
